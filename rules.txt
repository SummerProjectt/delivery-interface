All changes must be done on a new branch. 
Then a pull request can be made for it to be merged with the main branch.

No one can verify their own pull requests.

Our branch naming convention will be as follows:
<branch-type>_<task-name>_<author-name>

Branch Types:
1. Bugs (bug)
2. Feature (feat)
3. Experimental (exp)


Guide to getting started:

What you need to download and set up::
Git - https://git-scm.com/downloads
Nodejs - https://nodejs.org/en/
VS Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/download


To Do::
Become a part of the organization:
    - Make a github account and send it to maximus to be added to the organization.
        
Set up Git:
    - Open Git Bash and configure your user name and email using the following:
        git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"
        git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"

    - Set VSCode as default git editor:
        git config --global core.editor "code --wait"


Clone github repository:
    -Using git bash navigate to the folder on your computer you want to store the project code in.
    -Enter the command : "git clone https://github.com/SummerProjectt/delivery-interface.git"

Open Project Folder:
    -When it is finished cloning you can move into the project folder using : "cd delivery-interface"
    -Open the code in VScode using the command : "code ."
    -You can also open the project folder by opening VScode and selecting open folder, then navigate to the project folder.

Install node_modules:
    -To install node_modules you can either use the Node.js command prompt to navigate to the project folder or open a new terminal in VScode while in the project folder.
    -Then you can enter the command: "npm install" or "npm i"
    -It takes a short while to install the node_modules

Run development server:
    -After all the above steps are completed the project should be ready for you to make changes.
    -The way to track these changes is with the development server.
    -In order to start it you can either use the Node.js command prompt to navigate to the project folder or open a new terminal in VScode while in the project folder.
    -Then you enter the command : "npm run dev"
    -You should see a message saying: "ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000"
    -You can open your browser and enter : "http://localhost:3000"
    -The current state of the project should appear load. 

Stop development server:
    -In the terminal where the server was started you can use the "ctrl-c" command to stop the development server.



Basic git commands:
    -git clone - adds a new repository on branch master.
    -git add - adds a new file that can later be committed(the term commited means save the newest version of a file)
    -git status - updates the user on the status of a particular file
    -git commit - this creates a new version of our file on the branch master (git commit -m: the option m adds a message so you know what changes you've made)
    -git commit -am adds and leaves a message, essentially combining the command git add to git commit -m
    -git push - pushes/adds the changes to the content you made to the server, the serve in this case is github
    -git pull - pulls new versions of code from the server to your local device
    -git log - keeps track of all the commits we've made to the code
    -git reset - if you made a change you didnt mean, and want to go back to previous commit. reverts from current to previous
    -git reset --hard "commit hash": will hard reset everything.
    -git reset --hard origin/master: origin/master is the version of your repository that is on github


    -git branch - lets you know what branch you are on, and what branches exist in your repository.
    -git branch -d - deletes a branch
    -git branch -a - lists all branches (local and remote)
    -git branch [brach name] - creates a new branch
    -git checkout -b style - this creates a new branch where "style" is the name of the new branch
    -git checkout [branchname] - this allows the user to change between branches.
    -git merge - will merge in changes made in other branches in 1 branch
