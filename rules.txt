All changes must be done on a new branch. 
Then a pull request can be made for it to be merged with the main branch.

No one can verify their own pull requests.

Our branch naming convention will be as follows:
<branch-type>_<task-name>_<author-name>

Branch Types:
1. Bugs (bug)
2. Feature (feat)
3. Experimental (exp)
